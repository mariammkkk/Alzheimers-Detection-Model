## Abstract
This project explores the feasibility of detecting Alzheimer's disease through the analysis of handwriting patterns. Leveraging the DARWIN dataset, 
which comprises diverse handwriting features from both healthy individuals and Alzheimer's patients, we develop and evaluate several machine learning models. 
Our methodology involves extensive exploratory data analysis, strategic feature selection based on different handwriting tasks, and a comparative study of 
Gaussian Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Logistic Regression classifiers. The objective is to identify robust predictive models 
that can contribute to early, non-invasive diagnostic support for Alzheimer's disease.

## ML Models Implemented
- Gaussian Naive Bayes
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Logistic Regression
